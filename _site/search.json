In any typical mail survey we should always remember that to get a response rate of 100% is nearly impossible. In the Malaysia context the response rates for mail survey is usually 10-20% only.\nTable 1\nResponse rate\n\n\n\n\nNumber/Frequency\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Questionnaires distributed\n500\n\n\nNumber of questionnaire returned\n120\n\n\nResponse rate\n24%\n\n\nNumber of usable questionnaire\n98\n\n\nEffective Response rate\n19.6%\n\n\n\nThere is a difference between response rate and effective response rate. The response rate is equal to the number of questionnaires received divided by the number of questionnaires sent out. The effective response rate on the other hand is equal to the number of usable questionnaire divided by the total number sent out.\nWhy is this necessary?\nWhen the response rate is low it raises question about the representativeness of the sample. We might have say a majority of small sized companies but our research objectives says that we would like to study small and medium sized enterprises. This by itself points to some sort of bias which needs to be highlighted later in the limitations of the study.\nAnother reason is the problem of non response. Would the responses of those who have not responded be different form those who responded? This can only be tested if we know the profile of the companies that have not responded or else this would be impossible to do. We can also justify this by doing a “wave analysis” as suggested by Armstrong and Overton (1977), which will be discussed later.\n\nAccording to Harbaugh (2002, p. 70). “Response rates for traditional mail surveys have continued to decline to a point where the average is below 20%.” The response rate of 19.6% matches the usual response rate of 10-20% using the same method in Malaysia. As the respondents for this study are key persons in the organization, they are known to be less likely to respond to mailed questionnaires than people in the general population (Hunt & Chonko 1987).\n\nReferences\nHarbaugh, R. (2002), “Proven lessons for generating good mail survey response rates”, Medical Marketing and Media, Vol 37 No 10, pp. 70-75.\nHunt, S.D. and Chonko, L.B. (1987), “Ethical Problems of Advertising Agency Executives”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 53 No 1, pp. 16-24.\nArmstrong, S. and Overton, T.S. (1977), “Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys”, Journal of Marketing Research, Vol 14, pp. 396-402.\n\n\n\nIn any report typically there will be a description of the profile of respondents. This is done to highlight that the profile suits the purpose of the study and also if it does not it can be used later to justify the non significance of some research hypotheses.\nTo do this we will ask for the frequency distribution of the nominal variables that we included in the profile section of our questionnaire.\nAnalyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf we have 10 nominal variables we will be getting 10 different tables like the ones above. We can also charts like the bar chart or the pie char as above. You do not need both in the report. The idea is that for academic report normally tables are used whereas for business presentation charts are more suitable. Kindly refrain from “cut and paste” syndrome. You will need to draw a frequency table like the one below.\n\n\nTable 2\nProfile of Respondents\n\nTable 2 summarizes the demographic profile of the respondents. In terms of respondents, almost 75% were male and they came from various departments although a bigger majority was from the Engineering department. Thus, we can conclude that the respondents are sufficiently well versed with the company and able to comprehend the needs of the questionnaire.\n\n\nDo not repeat the information contained in the Table 2. For example, “There are 75% male whilst the remaining 25% were female”. This statement does not bring to bear any new information, not already contained in the Table, thus translating it into prose form is futile.\n\nWhen writing the description, pick the pattern that is supporting the arguments that your sample is appropriate to the subject of the study and that the data are obtained from credible sources.\n\nThe whole idea of having the sample profile is to ensure that data thus obtained from the sample you obtained, is credible and therefore provide useful basis for the subsequent analysis and inference.\n\n\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\n\n\nAll nominal variables are profiled in a table to show the profile of the respondents or responding companies.\nWho are our respondents?\n\n\n\nDescriptive analysis\n\n\n\nHistogram\nMean and Standard deviation\nSkewness and Kurtosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1:\nComplete the table with the other demographic profile characteristics of the respondents.\nQuestion:\nIs our sample representative?\n\n\nWe must also remember that not all demographic variables are nominal in nature. For example in our questionnaire, age, organizational tenure and work tenure were actual number of years not in terms of interval classes as such a frequency analysis would be futile.\nWe would ask for a descriptive analysis where the mean and standard deviation of the variables would be noted. The proper table is presented below.\nTable 3\nDescriptive profile of respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nA short description should be written to explain the table like this. For age (M = 33.39, SD = 8.823) suggests that the workforce in this company is young with organizational tenure (M = 5.36, SD = 4.435) which shows that most were still in the first few years of their employment with this company whereas the work tenure (M = 9.04, SD = 7.276) suggests that the workforce may be very mobile with movement from job to job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the current level of the variables of interest?\n\n\nTYPICAL QUESTIONS\n\n\nWhat is the level of intention to share information in the organization?\n\nWhat is the level of actual sharing in the organization?\n\n\nTo do this we will ask for the descriptive analysis of the continuous variables that we computed from our questionnaire.\n\nAnalyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Descriptives\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 4\nDescriptive statistics of the intention to share and actual sharing in the organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nIntention to share information (M = 3.82, SD = 0.639) suggest that the workforce in this company have high intention to share information. An examination of actual sharing (M = 4.06, SD = 0.583) also shows that they do actually share information among the colleagues in the same organization.\n\nThe above reflects the general situation; differences do occur across position, department, gender, position and educational level. This will be explored later.\n\n\nExercise 2:\n\nComplete the table with the other main variables of the study and a short description of each variable.\n\n\n\n\nChi Square tests can be divided into 2 types:\n\n\nTest for independence\n\n\n\nThis test is used when you wish to explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables with each having 2 or more categories\n\nExample “Is the proportion of male employees with high intention to share information the same as the proportion of female with high intention to share information?”\n\nGender has (1= Male/2=Female) whereas Level we have (1=Low/2=High)\n\nWe will have a (2 X 2) contingency table\n\n\n\nGoodness of Fit\n\n\n\nThis test is used to see if a given distribution follows a theoretical distribution say a normal, binomial or whatever distribution.\n\n\nTo use the test for independence we will ask for the descriptive analysis and then select crosstabs and use the variables gender and position in the analysis.\n\nAnalyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Crosstabs\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\nThe Continuity Correction value represents the Yates Correction for Continuity, this value is designed to correct or compensate for what some writers feel is an overestimate of the chi-square value when used with a 2 X 2 table. (Pallant, 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption:\n\n\n\nThe lowest expected frequency in any cell should be 5 or more. Some authors suggest a less stringent criterion: at least 80 percent of cells should have expected frequencies of 5 or more (Pallant, 2001). The assumption is tested by looking at the (b) which gives us the % of cells with expected values less than 5. If the value exceeds 20% then this test is not valid.\n\n\nReference\nPallant, J. (2001). SPSS Survival Manual: A step by step guide to data analysis using SPSS for Windows (Version 10), NSW, Australia: Allen & Unwin.\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 5\nPercentage Distribution of Low and High Intention to share Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) value of 7.704 (p< 0.01) indicates that intention to share information is not independent of gender. We can see that for males, 23.6% have high intention to share compared to only 4.2% among female. Thus we can conclude that male employees have higher intention to share.\n\n\nExercise 3:\nTest whether the level of intention to share is independent of department, position and education level.\n\n\n\n\nNon response Bias is a test to determine whether responses of those who have not responded are different from those who responded? This can only be tested if we know the profile of the companies that have not responded or else this would be impossible to do. We can also justify this by doing a “wave analysis” as suggested by Armstrong and Overton (1977), which will be discussed later.\n\n\nAs suggested by Zou et al. (1997), owing to the lack of comparable data from the non-responding firms, direct comparison of the responding and non-responding firms was not possible. We used the wave analysis method with the Student’s t-test as the next best approach to compare between the early and late replies (replies received after the follow up contacts) as suggested by Armstrong and Overton (1977). The wave analysis method assumes that those who respond less readily are more like non-respondents. (Zou et al., 1997). They suggested using the t-test procedure under the assumptions of both equal and unequal group variances. In the t-test analysis, we found no between-group mean differences at the 5% level for any of the variables in the study. Thus, it may be concluded that non-response bias was not of particular influence in this research. (Skarmeas et al., 2002).\n\n\nReferences\nHarbaugh, R.

Normally we will allow say about 2 months as cut off date for returns after the first posting and then when we send reminders; all the subsequent returns will be classified as late returns. We usually code them say 1=Early and 2=Late. So we have created another new nominal variable called response.\n\n\nSome researchers also do the postings using waves, ie; first wave and second wave. If that is the case then we have to also test the returns of the first wave with those of the second wave.\n\nSPSS Outputs\n\n\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 6\nChi Square test for Early versus Late responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nIn comparing the demographic profiles of the early and late responses, it is noted that there is little difference in terms of gender (31.9% early responses from males compared to 33.3% early responses from females). The Chi-Square value of 0.000 suggests that there are no differences at all in the pattern of responses in terms of gender.\n\nOn the whole, one can argue that there is little significant difference in the demographic profiles of the early and late responses; thus we can conclude that the sample is representative of the population of interest.\n\n\nExercise 4:\nTest whether the there are any non-response bias for the other demographic variables of department, position and education level.\n\n\n\n\nThe second test that uses the Chi Square is the goodness of fit test. This test is done to ascertain if the sample follows a pre-specified distribution. Let’s say we would to test whether the gender follows a Chi square distribution proportion of 50%.\n\nAnalyze --> Nonparametric Test --> Chi-Square\n\nThe null hypothesis states that the sample follows a Chi Square distributionwith p = 0.5 whereas the alternate says it does not follow this distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nSince the p-value < 0.05, thus we accept the alternate that states that the distribution does not follow the stated distribution. This is evident from the distribution as 75% of the samples are males whereas only 25% are females. If the distribution is followed then we should be getting 50% males and 50% females."

There were significant differences in the scores for males (M=3.90, SD=0.60), and females [M=3.58, SD=0.69; t(190)=2.93, p=0.002]. The magnitude of the differences in the means was moderate (eta squared= 0.05).\n\n\nEffect Size\nEffect size is to test if the statistical differences found is truly sufficient and not by chance. Although sometimes the difference is significant, it may be because of the large sample size where very small differences will be significant. Effect size calculates the strength of the association which indicates the relative magnitude of the differences between means. Tabachnick and Fidell (1996, p. 53) described this as “amount of total variance that is predictable from the knowledge of the levels of the independent variable”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne common measure of effect size is eta squared. Eta squared represents the proportion of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable (Pallant, 2001). To interpret the strength we can follow the guidelines of Cohen (1988) which is as follows:\n 0.01 = small effect size\n 0.06 = moderate effect; and\n 0.14 = large effect size\n\n\n\nFormula:\n\\[\nEta\\ Squared\\ =\\ \\frac{t^2}{t^2\\ +\\ (N_1\\ +\\ N_2\\ -\\ 2)}\n\\]\n\\[\nEta\\ Squared\\ =\\ \\frac{3.12^2}{3.12^2\\ +\\ (144\\ +\\ 48\\ -\\ 2)}\\ =\\ 0.049\n\\]\nReferences\nCohen, J.W.

Normally it is done as an experimental design like pre/post. Say you want to compare sales prior to an advertisement campaign and sales after the sales campaign to see how much sales has increased after the sales campaign. In this test the N remains the same whereas for the earlier independent samples t-test, the N becomes divided into 2 categories say male/female.\n\nIn our data we have intention to share rated by the respondent and also actual sharing rated by the same respondent as such we can compare to see if the intention and actual sharing differs significantly.\n\nAnalyze --> Compare Means --> Paired-Samples T Test\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 7\nPaired t-test Result\n\n\nFormula:\n\n\\[\nEta\\ Squared\\ =\\ \\frac{t^2}{t^2\\ +\\ N\\ -\\ 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\nEta\\ Squared\\ =\\ \\frac{(-9.05)^2}{(-9.05)^2\\ +\\ 30\\ -\\ 1}\\ =\\ 0.3\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nA paired sample t-test was conducted to evaluate if the intention to share and actual sharing are significantly different. There is a statistical difference in intention to share and actual sharing (M=3.82, SD=0.64), and females [M=4.06, SD=0.58; t(191)=-9.05, p=0.000]. The magnitude of the differences in the means was large (eta squared= 0.30).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is the equivalent test for an independent samples t-test in nonparametric testing. It is undertaken when we want to compare the median value of some continuous variable across two different groups. For example we would like to test whether intention to share information differs by gender, say you hypothesize that male have higher intention to share compared to females. The Gender variable is nominal (independent) whereas the criterion variable intention to share information is continuous (dependent) and if we assume that the distribution is not normal or the sample size is small then we can resort to this test. What this test does is to first convert the continuous variable into ranks and then the mean ranks are compared. We lose some data in this process.\n\nAnalyze --> Nonparametric Test --> 2 Independent Samples\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nFrom the output we can conclude that there are statistical significant differences (Z=-3.266, p< 0.01) in terms of intention to share among males and female employees. Males employees have higher intention to share as evidenced by the higher mean rank values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is the nonparametric equivalent of the paired t-test is undertaken when we want to compare the median value of two continuous variables rated by the same person. Normally it is done as an experimental design like pre/post. Say you want to compare sales prior to an advertisement campaign and sales after the sales campaign to see how much sales has increased after the sales campaign. In this test the N remains the same whereas for the earlier independent samples t-test, the N becomes divided into 2 categories say male/female.\n\nAnalyze --> Nonparametric Test --> 2 Related samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nFrom the output we can conclude that there are statistical significant differences (Z=-8278, p< 0.01) in terms of intention to share and actual sharing. Intention to share has been rated lower consistently by the respondents as evidenced by the higher positive mean rank values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA one way ANOVA is used when we want to compare a continuous variable across more than 2 groups which are also called the “between-groups” test.\n\nAnalyze --> Compare Means --> One-Way ANOVA\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\nPost Hoc Tests: Homogeneous Subsets\n\n\n\nEffect Size\n\n\\(Formula\\ =\\ \\frac{Sum\\ of\\ Squares\\ Between\\ Group}{Total\\ Sum\\ of\\ Squares}\\)\n\n\\(Effect\\ Size\\ = \\frac{3.251}{77.933}\\ =\\ 0.04\\)\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 8\nDifferences in the Intention to share by Educational Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nA one-way between-group ANOVA was conducted to test whether intention to share differed by level of education. There was a statistically significant differences at the p< 0.05 level in intention scores for the 4 educational levels [F(3,188) = 2.728, p=0.045]. Despite reaching statistical significance, the actual difference in mean scores between the groups was quite small. The effect size, calculated using the eta squared, was 0.04. Post-hoc comparison using the Duncan’s range test indicated that the mean score for Masters (M=3.51, SD=0.92) and First degree (M=3.82, SD=0.62) was statistically different from PhD (M=4.40, SD=0.46). Those with Diploma education (M=3.89, SD=0.47) did not differ statistically from the PhD group.\n\n\nExercises\n\n\nRepeat the same anaysis for Job Position and Age Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis Test is the nonparametric equivalent test for the one way ANOVA. It allows us to compare the scores on a continuous variable across three or more groups. This is also called a “between groups” analysis.\n\nAnalyze --> Nonparametric Test --> k Independent Samples\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\nIn Report APA Style\nTable 9\nDifferences in the Intention to share by Educational Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThere are no significant differences in the intention to share among employees with different educational background (2=4.543, p> 0.01). This point to the conclusion that employees have the same level of intention to share does not matter what education level they have attained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Friedman Test is the nonparametric equivalent of the one way repeated measure ANOVA. The idea is to compare say the ratings of several variables by the same respondent to see if there are differences. It is also called repeated measure within subjects test.\n\nAnalyze --> Nonparametric Test --> k Related Samples\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\nIn Report APA Style  Table 10\nFriedman Two-Way ANOVA Result\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThere are significant differences in the ratings of the 5 questions by the respondents (\\(\\chi ^2\\) = 42.830, p < 0.01). Some of the items are rated much higher as compared to the other items like Reciprocal3 is rated the lowest\n\n\nTest for Concordance\nThis is a test to compare if the there is agreement among the respondents in terms of their rating of each of the items. The Kendall’s W value will tell us if there is agreement or not. A higher value closer to 1 indicates there is strong agreement whereas a value closer to 0 indicates that there is no agreement at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe analysis shows that there is little agreement among the raters (\\(\\chi ^2\\) = 42.830, p < 0.01). This can be inferred from the low value of Kendall’s W which is only 0.056.\n\n\nExercise 6:\nTest whether the there are differences in terms of intention to share and actual sharing across position and department."

In the case of nominal independent variables, dummy variables are introduced.\n\n\\(Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + e\\)\n\nWhere:\n\\(Y\\) = Dependent variable\n\\(a\\) = Intercept\n\\(b_1,\\ b_2,\\ b_3\\) = regression coefficients (slope)\n\\(X_1,\\ X_2,\\ X_3\\) = Independent variables\n\\(e\\) = random error\n\nThings to consider:\n\n\nStrong Theory (conceptual or theoretical)\n\nMeasurement Error\n\n\n\nThe degree to which the variable is an accurate and consistent measure of the concept being studied. If the error is high than even the best predictors may not be able to achieve sufficient predictive accuracy.\n\n\n\nSpecification error\n\n\n\nInclusion of irrelevant variables or the omission of relevant variables from the set of independent variables.\n\n\nASSUMPTIONS:\n\n\n\nOne of the basic assumptions is the normality which can be assessed by plotting the histogram. If the histogram shows not much deviation then we can assume the data follows a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second assumption is that the error term must be normally distributed. This can be assessed by looking at the normal P-P plot. The idea is that the points should be as close as possible to the diagonal line. If they are then we can assume that the error terms are normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third assumption is the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable must be linear. This is assessed by looking at the partial plots. The idea is to see if we can draw a straight line on the scatter plot that is generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fourth assumption is that the variance must be constant (Homoscedasticity) as opposed to not constant (Heterosedasciticity). Heterosedasciticity is generally observed when we see a consistent pattern when we plot the studentized residual (SRESID) against the predicted value of Y (ZPRED).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth assumption is the collinearity problem. This is a problem when the independent variables are highly correlated among one another, generally at r > 0.8 to 0.9 which is termed as multicollinearoty. As the term independent variables connotes they should not be correlated at all among one another, low to moderate correlations are the norm and does not pose any serious problems. To assess this assumption we will look at two indicators. The first one is the VIF and tolerance. A low tolerance value of < 0.1 will result in a VIF value of > 10 as VIF is actually 1/Tolerance. If the value is more than 10 we can suspect there is a problem of multicollinearity. The second value that we should look at is the conditional index. If this value exceeds 30 we can also suspect the presence of multicollinearity. When the value is more than 30 we should also look across the variance proportions and see if we can spot any 2 or more variables with a value of 0.9 and above excluding the constant. If there are 2 or more than only we can conclude there is multicollinearity."
