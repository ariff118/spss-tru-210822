## TEST OF DIFFERENCES\

**PURPOSE:**\
- To test whether a variable of interest differ significantly across 3 or more sub-groups of the population, or\
- To test whether 2 or more subgroups of the population differ in terms of one or more variable of interest, or\
- To test whether 2 or more variables are rated differently by the population.\

**WHEN:**\
- To establish whether two or more groups are statistically significantly different in terms of a particular variable of interest.\
- To establish whether two or more variables are rated significantly different by the population. This is to establish definite ranking/ordering\

**TECHNIQUES:**\
- Parametric Techniques: t-test; paired t-test, 1-way ANOVA, 2-way ANOVA\
- Non-Parametric Techniques: Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon rank sum test; Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, Kruskal Wallis; Friedman test\

### a. Test of differences (2 means) Independent Samples\

An independent samples t-test is undertaken when we want to compare the mean value of some continuous variable across two different groups. For example we would like to test whether intention to share information differs by gender, say you hypothesize that male have higher intention to share compared to females. The Gender variable is nominal (independent) whereas the criterion variable intention to share information is continuous (dependent) so we can use a t-test.\

::: callout-discussion
An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the intention to share scores for males and females. There were significant differences in the scores for males (M=3.90, SD=0.60), and females [M=3.58, SD=0.69; t(190)=2.93, p=0.002]. The magnitude of the differences in the means was moderate (eta squared= 0.05).
:::

**Effect Size**\
Effect size is to test if the statistical differences found is truly sufficient and not by chance. Although sometimes the difference is significant, it may be because of the large sample size where very small differences will be significant. Effect size calculates the strength of the association which indicates the relative magnitude of the differences between means. `Tabachnick and Fidell (1996, p. 53)` described this as “amount of total variance that is predictable from the knowledge of the levels of the independent variable”\

::: callout-note
One common measure of effect size is eta squared. Eta squared represents the proportion of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable (`Pallant, 2001`). To interpret the strength we can follow the guidelines of `Cohen (1988)` which is as follows:\
 0.01 = small effect size\
 0.06 = moderate effect; and\
 0.14 = large effect size\
:::

**Formula:**\
$$
Eta\ Squared\ =\ \frac{t^2}{t^2\ +\ (N_1\ +\ N_2\ -\ 2)}
$$

$$
Eta\ Squared\ =\ \frac{3.12^2}{3.12^2\ +\ (144\ +\ 48\ -\ 2)}\ =\ 0.049
$$

### b. Test of differences (2 means)- Dependent Samples\

A paired t-test is undertaken when we want to compare the mean value of two continuous variables rated by the same person. Normally it is done as an experimental design like pre/post. Say you want to compare sales prior to an advertisement campaign and sales after the sales campaign to see how much sales has increased after the sales campaign. In this test the N remains the same whereas for the earlier independent samples t-test, the N becomes divided into 2 categories say male/female.\

In our data we have intention to share rated by the respondent and also actual sharing rated by the same respondent as such we can compare to see if the intention and actual sharing differs significantly.\

$$

::: callout-discussion
A paired sample t-test was conducted to evaluate if the intention to share and actual sharing are significantly different. There is a statistical difference in intention to share and actual sharing (M=3.82, SD=0.64), and females [M=4.06, SD=0.58; t(191)=-9.05, p=0.000]. The magnitude of the differences in the means was large (eta squared= 0.30).

### c. Test of differences (2 means) - Independent Samples Nonparametric\

The `Mann-Whitney U test` is the equivalent test for an independent samples t-test in **nonparametric** testing. It is undertaken when we want to compare the median value of some continuous variable across two different groups. For example we would like to test whether intention to share information differs by gender, say you hypothesize that male have higher intention to share compared to females. The Gender variable is nominal (independent) whereas the criterion variable intention to share information is continuous (dependent) and if we assume that the distribution is not normal or the sample size is small then we can resort to this test. What this test does is to first convert the continuous variable into ranks and then the mean ranks are compared. We lose some data in this process.\

::: callout-discussion
From the output we can conclude that there are statistical significant differences (Z=-3.266, p< 0.01) in terms of intention to share among males and female employees. Males employees have higher intention to share as evidenced by the higher mean rank values.

### d. Test of differences (2 means)- Dependent Samples Nonparametric\

The `Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test` is the nonparametric equivalent of the paired t-test is undertaken when we want to compare the median value of two continuous variables rated by the same person. Normally it is done as an experimental design like pre/post. Say you want to compare sales prior to an advertisement campaign and sales after the sales campaign to see how much sales has increased after the sales campaign. In this test the N remains the same whereas for the earlier independent samples t-test, the N becomes divided into 2 categories say male/female.\

From the output we can conclude that there are statistical significant differences (Z=-8278, p< 0.01) in terms of intention to share and actual sharing. Intention to share has been rated lower consistently by the respondents as evidenced by the higher positive mean rank values.

### e. Test of differences (> 2 means) - Independent Samples\

A one way ANOVA is used when we want to compare a continuous variable across more than 2 groups which are also called the `“between-groups”` test.\

::: callout-discussion
A one-way between-group ANOVA was conducted to test whether intention to share differed by level of education. There was a statistically significant differences at the p< 0.05 level in intention scores for the 4 educational levels [F(3,188) = 2.728, p=0.045]. Despite reaching statistical significance, the actual difference in mean scores between the groups was quite small. The effect size, calculated using the eta squared, was 0.04. Post-hoc comparison using the Duncan’s range test indicated that the mean score for Masters (M=3.51, SD=0.92) and First degree (M=3.82, SD=0.62) was statistically different from PhD (M=4.40, SD=0.46). Those with Diploma education (M=3.89, SD=0.47) did not differ statistically from the PhD group.

### f. Test of differences (> 2 means) - Independent Samples Nonparametric\

The Kruskal-Wallis Test is the nonparametric equivalent test for the one way ANOVA. It allows us to compare the scores on a continuous variable across three or more groups. This is also called a “between groups” analysis.\

::: callout-discussion
There are no significant differences in the intention to share among employees with different educational background (2=4.543, p> 0.01). This point to the conclusion that employees have the same level of intention to share does not matter what education level they have attained.

### g. Test of differences (> 2 means) - Dependent Samples Nonparametric\

The Friedman Test is the nonparametric equivalent of the one way repeated measure ANOVA. The idea is to compare say the ratings of several variables by the same respondent to see if there are differences. It is also called repeated measure within subjects test.\

::: callout-discussion
There are significant differences in the ratings of the 5 questions by the respondents ($\chi ^2$ = 42.830, p < 0.01). Some of the items are rated much higher as compared to the other items like Reciprocal3 is rated the lowest
:::

**Test for Concordance**\
This is a test to compare if the there is agreement among the respondents in terms of their rating of each of the items. The Kendall’s W value will tell us if there is agreement or not. A higher value closer to 1 indicates there is strong agreement whereas a value closer to 0 indicates that there is no agreement at all.\

![](images/slot3_table10c.png)\

::: callout-discussion
The analysis shows that there is little agreement among the raters ($\chi ^2$ = 42.830,
p < 0.01). This can be inferred from the low value of Kendall’s W which is only 0.056.
:::

**Exercise 6:**\
Test whether the there are differences in terms of intention to share and actual sharing across position and department.\
