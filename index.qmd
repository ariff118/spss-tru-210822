## General Information

### Description

This is a full day beginner to intermediate level workshop on how to analyze survey data recorded from a structured questionnaire using IBM SPSS Statistics.

### Expectations and Goals

At the end of the session, participant will be able to know how to handle survey data and prepare the data for further analysis using statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics (any version). In addition, participant will know how to analyze data with respect to specific research questions or objectives, and eventually present the result in proper way in papers or articles for publication purposes.

## Workshop Materials

### Required Materials

-   IBM SPSS Statistics (any version -- IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 will be provided if participant don't have one installed in his or her computer)
-   Presentation slides (provided by instructor)
-   Data set (provided by instructor or use own data set)

### Optional Materials

Will be provided during the workshop if any.

## Fundamentals of Data Analysis

3 Most Common Basic Analysis in Research

### 1. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS

**PURPOSE:**

- Describe the distribution of the variable of interest.

**TECHNIQUES:**

- Frequencies and Cross-tabulations for Nominal or Categorical Variables
- Means and Means by sub-groups for Continuous Data

**WHEN DO WE USE THEM IN THE RESEARCH?**

- Describing the Sample Profile
- Issue of Representativeness - Non-Response Bias

### 2. TEST OF DIFFERENCES

**PURPOSE:**

- To test whether a variable of interest differ significantly across 3 or more sub-groups of the population, or
- To test whether 2 or more subgroups of the population differ in terms of one or more variable of interest, or
- To test whether 2 or more variables are rated differently by the population.

**WHEN:**

- To establish whether two or more groups are statistically significantly different in terms of a particular variable of interest.
- To establish whether two or more variables are rated significantly different by the population. This is to establish definite ranking/ordering

**TECHNIQUES:**

- Parametric Techniques: t-test; paired t-test, 1-way ANOVA, 2-way ANOVA
- Non-Parametric Techniques: Mann-Whitney/ Wilcoxon rank sum test; Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, Kruskal Wallis; Friedman test  

### 3. ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS\

**PURPOSE:**\

- To establish dependence (cause-effect) relationships between two or more variables\
- To establish the inter-relationships between two or more variables.\

**TECHNIQUES:**\

- Dependence Relationships\
  - Correlation\
  - Multiple Regression\
  - Discriminant Analysis\
  
- Non-dependence Relationships\
  - Correlation – Canonical Correlations\
  - Factor Analysis\
